<!-- AC/DC-->

<h3>AC/DC!!! One of the most iconic kick butt rock bands of all time! In my opinion they are the greatest live band of all time, their concerts are always filled with energy, lights, and ROCK! Angus Young especially knows how to rock a stadium with his confident moves and guitar riffs! ( R.I.P malcom young and bon scott) </h3>

<!-- Led Zeppelin-->

<h1>#2 Led Zeppelin</h1>

<h3>Led Zeppelin came in above AC/DC because of there song writing, AC/DC's songs all sound VERY similar well Zeppelin uses variety and all of there songs are unique and awesome, Robert plant is one of my favorite singers with his awesome vocal lines too! Jimmy page may be a bit sloppy live but hey, he makes it work and looks cool well doing it! especially with his double neck SG! </h3>

<!-- Pink floyd-->

<h1>#1 Pink Floyd  </h1>

<h3>It was such a close tie between Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, but overall the general public likes Pink Floyd better. If you were to ask me my opinion, I would say its a tie, I like Jimmy Pages style, and Robert Plants vocals, but Pink Floyds overall songs are usually better, David gilmours solos, Richard Wrights keyboard, Roger Waters Bass, and awesome vocals and Nick Masons drums put together turn out amazing almost every time. This band even created a whole new sub-genre known as "Space Rock"</h3>
