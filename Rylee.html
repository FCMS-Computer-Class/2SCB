    <h1>Basics</h1>
    
    <p> Some basic things you will need for a kitten are a collar, food and water bowls, food, litter box, litter, toys, and a bed or a blanket. You need to make sure you can afford everything before you get a kitten. They require some work when they are young, but when they get older it is very easy to care for you kitten. </p>
    
    <p> The preparation for the animal is the most expensive part. Before yoy get the kitten, you want have a little corner in a room for the kitten. What you want is to have the toys in a basket or in the bed or blanket, the food and water under a mat if you wanted so the water and food won't go everywhere, and the litter box on the opposite side of the food and water. Other things you could get for the kitten are cat towers, a play pin depend ing on how young you get the kitten, and automatic feeders.</p>

    <h1>Care</h1>
   
    <p> The kitten will need lots of care. Depending on how long, you might need to bottle feed with kitten formula. If you don't need to, then just make sure the kitten doesn't get sick and take it to the vet when needed. You don't want to risk any chances of it getting sick.</p>
