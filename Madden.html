        <h2><em>Care...</em></h2>
    <p>These dogs (despite their level of energy) are not high maintenence pets. They do need attention, but not a ton. If this dog gets a sickness or injury, you simply take them to a vet. Luckly, the Border Collie is a healthy breed that does <em>not</em> commonly have health problems. Because these are smaller dogs, the food, beds, and other such items like toys, are cheaper than most dog items, which is a bonus.</p>
    <h2><em>Grooming...</em></h2>
    <p>These dogs have realativly easy coats to manage. They need an average amount of grooming. A silmple once a week brushing or bath skould keep their coat shiny and clean. If your dog gets dirty or smelly, then bathe them and brush afterwords. Now how do you brush a border collie? Well, first collect a brush (best brush for a border collie is a <em>slick brush</em>), then a small doggie bag (for the fur). You may want to put a leash on your dog and tether it to something to keep it from moving around too much. Now, brush the dog starting at the head and slowlly moving down the body. Once the brush is full of hair, pull it off the brush and put it in the doggie bag (this is simply to prevent a mess). Continue this proccess until you are satisfied with the look of your dog's coat!</p>
