        <h3>My scratch (its programing and colleges have that)</h3>
        <p>Why I say you should go to college is also because if you like to code they have colleges that have coding two and I can show an app that is great for praticing. So that when you show up too that college you already have some experience with coding because that is what scratch is made for. And why I bring up codeing is because it is actually very inportant because that is how video games and websites and we always. Its easy, to see click <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/"target="_blank">here</a></p>
