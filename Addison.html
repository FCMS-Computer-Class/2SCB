        <p>My <em>FAVORITE</em> hobbies are horse back riding and gaming. Horses are my favorite animals, and I even took            horse back riding lessons for a few years! Since I can't have a horse in real life, I can play video games that allow         me to have <em>hundreds</em> of horses! That is one reason I like gaming, but the biggest reasons I like gaming is           because it's a way of escaping from the real world and jumping into an alternate universe, and because you can do            whatever you like and you get to do it with all of your friends even when you're not able to see them in real life!          </p>

        <p>Though it is not my cup of tea, here is another activity that entertains many people. On the Scratch website you          can create your own games and stories, <em>and</em> make them accesible to other people to play or watch! Scratch is a great way to kill time and brinh your dream games to life! It may take prectice to learn how to work it, but once you've got the hang of it you can make incredible things!
